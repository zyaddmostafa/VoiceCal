### Multi-Flavor Configuration
- **Development**: `com.example.voicecal.dev` - Firebase project: `voice-cal-a63f4`
- **Production**: `com.example.voicecal` - Firebase project: `voice-cal-a63f4`

Entry points:
- `lib/main_development.dart` - Development flavor
- `lib/main_production.dart` - Production flavor

## Key Dependencies & Patterns

### State Management
- **flutter_bloc**: Primary state management
- Pattern: BLoC with Events, States, and Repositories
- Local state: Use StatefulWidget for simple UI state

### Networking
- **dio**: HTTP client with interceptors
- **retrofit**: Type-safe API client generation
- **pretty_dio_logger**: Development logging
- Pattern: Repository pattern with data sources

### Storage
- **hive**: Local object storage and caching
- **flutter_secure_storage**: Sensitive data storage
- **shared_preferences**: Simple key-value storage
- **firebase_core**: Cloud data persistence

### Authentication
- **firebase_core**: Primary auth provider
- **google_sign_in**: Google OAuth integration
- **flutter_facebook_auth**: Facebook login
- Pattern: Unified auth repository with multiple providers

### UI/UX
- **flutter_screenutil**: Responsive design (375x812 base)
- **lottie**: Animations and micro-interactions
- **skeletonizer**: Loading states
- **iOS Design Language**: Premium iOS-style components

## Development Workflow

### Build & Run Commands
```bash
# Development flavor
flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Production flavor  
flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart

# Build APK
flutter build apk --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart
```

### Code Generation
```bash
# Generate code for all builders
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# Watch for changes
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch

# Clean generated files
flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
```

### Firebase Configuration
- Development: `android/app/src/development/google-services.json`
- Production: `android/app/src/main/google-services.json`
- Each flavor requires separate Firebase app configuration

## Voice Calorie Tracking Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Voice Input**: Primary interaction method for logging meals
2. **Nutrition Database**: Food recognition and calorie calculation
3. **Goal Setting**: Daily calorie and macro targets
4. **Progress Tracking**: Historical data and analytics
5. **Social Features**: Sharing and community aspects

### user Journey
User Journey

1. Welcome Screen ‚Äì Premium iOS-style introduction.

2. Onboarding (step-by-step, clean screens):

Gender ‚Üí Age ‚Üí Height & Weight ‚Üí Activity ‚Üí Goal Weight ‚Üí Goal Speed ‚Üí Calorie Rollover ‚Üí Results.

3. Home Dashboard ‚Äì Daily calorie target, progress bar, and quick ‚ÄúLog Meal‚Äù button.

4. Meal Logging ‚Äì User taps üé§, says their meal, app transcribes + parses into food items.

5. Tracking & Analysis ‚Äì Line/bar charts (using fl_chart) show calories/macros vs. goals.

6. Insights Screen ‚Äì Weekly reports, tips, and adjustments.

## Coding Standards

### File Organization
- Feature-based modules in `lib/features/`
- Shared code in `lib/core/`
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Group related files by feature, not by type

### Naming Conventions
- Files: `snake_case.dart`
- Classes: `PascalCase`
- Variables/functions: `camelCase`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Private members: prefix with `_`

### Widget Design
- Use **ScreenUtil** for responsive sizing
- Follow iOS design language for premium feel
- Implement proper loading states with **Skeletonizer**
- Add haptic feedback for user interactions
- Support both light and dark themes

### State Management Pattern
```dart
// BLoC Event
class LoadUserProfile extends ProfileEvent {}

// BLoC State  
class ProfileLoaded extends ProfileState {
  final User user;
  ProfileLoaded(this.user);
}

// Repository Pattern
class ProfileRepository {
  final ProfileRemoteDataSource _remoteDataSource;
  final ProfileLocalDataSource _localDataSource;
  
  Future<User> getProfile() async {
    try {
      final user = await _remoteDataSource.getProfile();
      await _localDataSource.cacheProfile(user);
      return user;
    } catch (e) {
      return _localDataSource.getCachedProfile();
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
- Use `Either<Failure, Success>` pattern for repositories
- Implement proper error states in BLoC
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic and repositories
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Mock external dependencies (Firebase, APIs)

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature
1. Create feature directory in `lib/features/`
2. Implement data layer (repositories, data sources)
3. Create BLoC for state management
4. Build presentation layer (screens, widgets)
5. Add navigation routes
6. Write tests

### Firebase Integration
1. Add service to Firebase console for each flavor
2. Download `google-services.json` to appropriate directories
3. Configure `firebase_options.dart`
4. Initialize in main entry points
5. Implement service-specific repositories

### API Integration
1. Define models with **json_annotation**
2. Create Retrofit API client
3. Implement repository with error handling
4. Add to dependency injection
5. Generate code with **build_runner**

## Voice Integration Considerations
- **Speech-to-Text**: For meal input and commands
- **Natural Language Processing**: Parse food descriptions
- **Offline Capability**: Cache voice recognition for poor connectivity
- **Privacy**: Local processing when possible
- **Accessibility**: Support for users with different speech patterns

## Performance Guidelines
- Use **Hive** for frequently accessed data
- Implement proper image caching for food photos
- Optimize voice processing for real-time feedback
- Use **Skeletonizer** for smooth loading experiences
- Implement pagination for large data sets

## Security Best Practices
- Store sensitive data in **flutter_secure_storage**
- Validate all voice input before processing
- Implement proper Firebase security rules
- Use HTTPS for all network requests
- Sanitize user-generated content

## Deployment
- Fastlane configuration for automated builds
- Separate Firebase projects for development/production
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

This guide should enable AI coding agents to immediately understand the VoiceCal architecture, contribute effectively to voice-powered nutrition tracking features, and maintain code quality standards.
